# Data-Analysis-Netflix-Dataset
This is the Data Analysis project based on the Netflix Dataset.
In this project we will perform all the process required to perform data analysis such as Understanding of our dataset, Data Cleaning, Data Pre-processing and Exploratory Data Analysis on our dataset. We will try to solve multiple test cases and will extract maximum insights from thses test cases with our dataset.
